- Capitalize First -- Refactored [0 times]
- Missing Number -- Refactored [0 times]

## Todo
- [x] Install npm and jest
- [x] Write unit tests for the challenges
- [x] Update readmes for all tests, include: title, description, code, tests and results.
- [ ] Think of a good way to write a test for fizz buzz without repeating the logic inside the test.
- [ ] Make difficulty sections for the challenges, easy, medium, hard.
