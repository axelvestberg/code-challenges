# Code Challenges

## Description
This repository will contain small coding problems and my solutions to them. I will also use these challenges to practice TDD to get in the mindset of writing tests first and maintain documentation. The unit tests will help alot when refactoring, reducing and improving code.


## Installation & Usage

Cd into folder:
```sh
cd code-challenges
```
Run npm install:
```
npm install
```
To run the unit tests, run:
```
npm test
```
By default it runs all the tests. To test a single file, run:
```
npm test -- filename
```

## Completed challenges

- FizzBuzz -- Refactored [0 times]
- First Factorial -- Refactored [1 time]
- Largest Swap -- Refactored [0 times]
- Capitalize First -- Refactored [0 times]
- Missing Number -- Refactored [0 times]
- Spelling -- Refactored [0 times]

## Todo challenges
- Discuss time complexity with different solutions.
- Find more challenges at: https://open.kattis.com/
- Anagram.
- Palaindrome.
- Reverse integer.
- Find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100.
- Find the duplicate number on a given integer array.
- Find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array.
- Find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number.
- Find duplicate numbers in an array if it contains multiple duplicates.
- Integer array sorted in place using the quicksort algorithm.
- Remove duplicates from an array in places.

## Todo
- Update main readme file so to correspond with each challenge readme + possibly find a way to automate this.
- [x] Install npm and jest.
- [x] Write unit tests for the challenges.
- [x] Update readmes for all tests, include: title, description, code, tests and results.
- [ ] Think of a good way to write a test for fizz buzz without repeating the logic inside the test.
- [ ] Make sections by type of challenge, e.g array, string, algorithm, sorting algorithms. 
- [x] Update all challenges with es6 syntax.
