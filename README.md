# Code Challenges

## Description
This repository will contain small coding problems and my solutions to them. I will also use these challenges to practice TDD to get in the mindset of writing tests first and maintain documentation. The unit tests will help alot when refactoring, reducing and improving code.


## Installation & Usage

Cd into folder:
```sh
cd code-challenges
```
Run npm install:
```
npm install
```
To run the unit tests, run:
```
npm test
```
By default it runs all the tests. To test a single file, run:
```
npm test -- filename
```

## Completed challenges

- FizzBuzz -- Refactored [0 times]
- First Factorial -- Refactored [1 time]
- Largest Swap -- Refactored [0 times]
- Capitalize First -- Refactored [0 times]
- Missing Number -- Refactored [0 times]
- Spelling -- Refactored [0 times]
- Maskify String -- Refactored [1 time]

## Todo
- [x] Install npm and jest
- [x] Write unit tests for the challenges
- [x] Update readmes for all tests, include: title, description, code, tests and results.
- [ ] Think of a good way to write a test for fizz buzz without repeating the logic inside the test.
- [ ] Make difficulty sections for the challenges, easy, medium, hard.
